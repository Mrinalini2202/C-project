Project Report — Bank System (C Project)
Date: 25 Nov 2025

1. Project overview
-------------------
This repository contains a small command-line bank account management system written in C. The program supports basic account operations and persists data to files.

2. Objectives
-------------
- Provide a simple CLI for creating, updating and viewing bank accounts.
- Keep code modular: separate source files for account logic, file I/O, and utilities.
- Use simple text files for persistent storage so the project is easy to inspect and extend.

3. Project structure (root)
---------------------------
- `src/` — C source files
  - `main.c`
  - `account_operations.c`
  - `file_operations.c`
  - `utils.c`
- `include/` — Header files
  - `account_operations.h`
  - `file_operations.h`
  - `utils.h`
- `data/` — Data files used by the program (accounts, records)
- `assets/`, `docs/` — Optional assets and documentation
- `sample_input.txt` — Example input file to try with the program
- `README.md` — Project README (added)
- `Makefile` — Build, run, and clean targets (added)

4. Build & run (recommended)
----------------------------
From the repository root (macOS / zsh):

Build using Makefile:

    make

Or compile directly with gcc:

    gcc src/*.c -I include -o bank_system

Run the program:

    ./bank_system

Run with sample input:

    ./bank_system < sample_input.txt

Clean build artifacts:

    make clean

5. Key implementation notes
---------------------------
- The code is split into logical modules: account operations, file operations, and utilities.
- The Makefile compiles all source files with `-I include` and `-std=c11`.
- No external libraries are required; the project uses standard C library only.

6. Testing
----------
- Quick manual test: run the program and exercise commands (create account, deposit, withdraw, list accounts).
- Use `sample_input.txt` to feed a sequence of commands via stdin for reproducible runs.

7. Known limitations & next steps
--------------------------------
- No automated unit tests; adding a test harness (e.g., using CUnit or a custom test runner) would increase reliability.
- Persistence is plain text; consider switching to a simple binary format or SQLite for more robust storage.
- Add input validation and better error handling (e.g., handle malformed data files gracefully).
- Add documentation for the input command syntax and example workflows in `docs/`.
